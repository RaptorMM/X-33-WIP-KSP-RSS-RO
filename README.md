# X-33-WIP-KSP-RSS-RO
configs by Raptor, feel free to take them and do use them however you want, if you edit them and repost, just keep my name as credits and add yours if you need/want to.
*mods required: CH4 (for the RS-2200), B9 wings, MK-33 and for now i only have TACLS support so kerbalism isn't compatible.
*installation: just throw the .cfg file into gamedate, and install both craft files into the subassemblies folder.

Just some configs I made for the MK-33 mod for RO

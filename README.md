# X-33-WIP-KSP-RSS-RO
configs by Raptor, feel free to take them and do use them however you want, if you edit them and repost, just keep my name as credits and add yours if you need/want to.
Just some configs I made for the MK-33 mod for RO
RCS consumes too much LOX and seems to not work on the aft tank, not sure if I just forgot the RCS module
That needs to be fixed, the cargo parts need to be scaled up and the wings too
Cabin does have enough tank volume for tacLS stuff, and fuel both at the same time, I'll be fixing that 
Today. Other than that everything else works well and the fuel amounts are right for 
All other fuel tanks.
